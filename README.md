# PCB Designs

A collection of my beginner PCB projects made with **EasyEDA Online**.  
I’m learning step by step and adding projects one by one.

## Projects
- **USB TYPE C Power Supply** — My first PCB following a tutorial; exported schematic, PCB image, and source files included.

> Skills level: Beginner (EasyEDA basics, schematic → PCB workflow)
